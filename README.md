# Snake Road: Safe Traffic Journey 🚗🐍

## About the Project

**Snake Road: Safe Traffic Journey** is a Python game built using **Pygame**.
In this game, a boy travels from **Home to School** on a snake-shaped road while avoiding vehicles and making decisions about stopping at different locations.

The project demonstrates:

* Game development using Python
* Event handling and collision detection
* Object-oriented programming
* Real-time traffic simulation
* Interactive UI design

---

## Features

* Snake-shaped dynamic road
* Moving traffic (cars, bikes, autos)
* Collision detection system
* Optional stops:

  * Market
  * Mall
  * Friend’s House
* Menu system and game states
* Return home option after reaching school
* Restart after accident
